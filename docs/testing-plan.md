# Testing Plan Documentation

## 1. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and APIs.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Test complete user flows from start to finish.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform exploratory testing to catch edge cases.

## 2. Unit Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** Jest
  - **Libraries:** React Testing Library
  - **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage.
- **Backend:**
  - **Framework:** Mocha
  - **Libraries:** Chai for assertions.
  - **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage.

## 3. Integration Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - Test interactions between UI components and state management (e.g., Redux).
- **Backend:**
  - Test API endpoints and database interactions.
  - Use tools like Supertest for API testing.

## 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Framework:** Cypress
- **Test Cases:**
  1. User onboarding (sign-up, login).
  2. Campaign creation and optimization.
  3. Content generation and optimization.
  4. Competitor analysis and keyword optimization.

## 5. Manual Testing
- **Exploratory Testing:** Perform ad-hoc testing to identify edge cases and usability issues.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involve stakeholders to validate the app against business requirements.

## 6. Performance Testing
- **Tools:** Apache JMeter or k6.
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Load testing for high-traffic scenarios.
  2. Stress testing to identify breaking points.
  3. API response time testing.

## 7. Security Testing
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Snyk.
- **Test Cases:**
  1. SQL injection and XSS vulnerability testing.
  2. Authentication and authorization testing.
  3. Rate limiting and DDoS protection testing.

## 8. CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions:**
  - Run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests on every pull request.
  - Block merging if tests fail.
- **SonarQube:**
  - Perform code quality and security analysis during CI/CD.

## 9. Reporting
- **Test Reports:** Generate detailed reports for each test run.
- **Dashboards:** Use Grafana or New Relic to visualize test results and performance metrics.
