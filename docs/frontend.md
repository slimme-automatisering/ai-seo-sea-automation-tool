# Frontend Documentation

## 1. UI Framework

- **Framework:** React.js
  - React.js is chosen for its flexibility, component-based architecture, and strong ecosystem, making it ideal for building a progressive web app (PWA).

## 2. UI Library

- **Primary Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
  - Material-UI provides a rich set of pre-built components following Google’s Material Design, ensuring a consistent and modern UI.
- **Secondary Library:** Tailwind CSS
  - Tailwind CSS will be used for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid custom designs and responsive layouts.
- **Recommendation:** Use Material-UI for core components (e.g., buttons, modals, tables) and Tailwind CSS for custom styling and layout adjustments. This combination ensures both consistency and flexibility.

## 3. Navigation

- **Top Navigation Bar:** For primary sections (e.g., Dashboard, SEO, SEA, Reports).
- **Side Menu:** For additional options and settings (e.g., user management, billing, integrations).
- **Tabs:** For switching between related views (e.g., SEO vs. SEA, Campaigns vs. Analytics).

## 4. Styling

- **Approach:** Styled Components
  - Styled Components will be used for CSS-in-JS, enabling dynamic theming (e.g., night and day modes) and scoped styles for components.

## 5. Forms

- **Login/Sign-Up Forms:** For user authentication, including email/password and social login options.
- **Campaign Creation Forms:** For setting up Google Ads campaigns, including ad copy, bidding parameters, and targeting options.
- **Content Generation Forms:** For inputting content parameters (e.g., keywords, tone, length) for AI-generated content.

## 6. Dashboard Components

- **Charts and Graphs:** Built using Plotly and Apache ECharts for displaying analytics (e.g., ROI trends, CPC performance).
- **Data Tables:** For showing raw data (e.g., keyword rankings, ad performance metrics).
- **Cards:** For summarizing key metrics (e.g., ROI, CPC, traffic) in a visually appealing way.

## 7. Responsive Design

- **Breakpoints:** Specific breakpoints will be defined for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices to ensure optimal responsiveness.
- **Touch Optimization:** No specific requirements for now, but the design will be touch-friendly by default.

## 8. Theming

- **Dynamic Theming:** Support for switching between night and day modes.
- **Branding Guidelines:** Not defined yet, but the theming system will be flexible to accommodate future branding requirements.

## 9. State Management

- **Global State Management:** Redux
  - Redux will be used for predictable state management across the app.
- **Database-Based State Management:** MongoDB
  - MongoDB will store persistent state data (e.g., user preferences, campaign settings).
- **Caching:** Redis
  - Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., analytics, competitor data) to improve performance.

## 10. Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading:** Components will be loaded only when needed (e.g., charts and tables when the user navigates to the analytics section).
- **Code Splitting:** The app will be split into smaller bundles to reduce initial load time.
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed data will be cached using Redis for faster retrieval.
