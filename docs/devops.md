# DevOps Documentation

## 1. Hosting
- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel
  - Vercel is chosen for its seamless integration with React.js and its ability to deploy PWAs with ease.
- **Backend Hosting:** Render or Heroku
  - Render is recommended for its simplicity and scalability, while Heroku is a reliable alternative.
- **Database Hosting:**
  - **PostgreSQL:** Hosted on AWS RDS or Heroku Postgres.
  - **MongoDB:** Hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions:** For continuous integration and deployment.
  - **Workflows:**
    1. **Linting and Formatting:** Run ESLint and Prettier on every pull request.
    2. **Unit Testing:** Run Jest tests for the frontend and backend.
    3. **Integration Testing:** Run Cypress end-to-end tests.
    4. **Deployment:** Automatically deploy to staging and production environments based on branch (e.g., `main` for production, `develop` for staging).

## 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Prometheus:** For collecting metrics from the backend.
- **Grafana:** For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.
- **New Relic:** For application performance monitoring and error tracking.
- **Sentry:** For frontend error tracking and performance monitoring.

## 4. Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Use Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Swarm to scale the backend services.
- **Load Balancer:** Use NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies based on CPU and memory usage.

## 5. Backup and Recovery
- **Automated Backups:** Use Celery to schedule daily backups of the database and critical files.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Store backups in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage with versioning enabled.
- **Restoration Process:** Document steps to restore the database and application in case of failure.

## 6. Environment Management
- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files for local development and inject environment variables via CI/CD for production.
- **Secrets Management:** Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to securely store API keys and credentials.

## 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform:** For provisioning cloud resources (e.g., AWS EC2, RDS, S3).
- **Ansible:** For configuring servers and deploying applications.

## 8. Logging
- **Centralized Logging:** Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch for centralized logging.
- **Log Retention:** Retain logs for 30 days by default, with options to extend for compliance purposes.
