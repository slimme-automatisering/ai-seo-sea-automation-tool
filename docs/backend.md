# Backend Documentation

## 1. Backend Framework
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
  - Node.js and Express.js are chosen for their lightweight and scalable nature, making them ideal for handling the appâ€™s backend requirements.

## 2. Database
- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
  - PostgreSQL is recommended for structured data (e.g., user accounts, campaign data, billing information) due to its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries.
- **Secondary Database:** MongoDB
  - MongoDB is recommended for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., AI-generated content, logs, analytics) due to its flexibility and schema-less design.
- **Recommendation:** Use PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for NoSQL use cases. This hybrid approach ensures optimal performance and flexibility.

USERS ||--o{ CAMPAIGNS : "manages"
  USERS {
    string id
    string email
    string passwordHash
    string role
  }
  CAMPAIGNS {
    string id
    string userId
    string name
    float budget
    date startDate
    date endDate
  }
  CONTENT {
    string id
    string campaignId
    string type
    string text
    date createdAt
  }
  KEYWORDS {
    string id
    string campaignId
    string keyword
    float cpc
  }
}
  
 ```

## 3. Authentication
- **Authentication Method:** OAuth 2.0
  - OAuth 2.0 will be used for Admin and Manager roles, allowing them to log in with their Google accounts and directly connect with Google APIs.
- **User Invitations:** Admins can invite User roles through their Google accounts and control permissions.
- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** An additional security layer will be implemented for all roles using OAuth 2.0.

---

## 4. API Design
- **RESTful APIs:** For integrations with external APIs (e.g., Google Ads API, WordPress REST API).
- **GraphQL:** For internal data queries requiring flexibility and scalability (e.g., fetching SEO/SEA performance data, dashboard visualizations).
- **WebSockets:** For real-time communication (e.g., live updates, notifications).
- **Security and Rate Limiting:** Strong security measures (e.g., HTTPS, input validation) and rate limiting will be implemented to prevent API misuse.

## 6. Caching
- **Redis:** For in-memory caching of frequently accessed data (e.g., analytics, competitor data).
- **Memcached:** For distributed caching (optional, depending on scaling needs).
- **Recommendation:** Start with Redis for its simplicity and performance. Memcached can be added later if distributed caching becomes necessary.

---

## 7. Background Jobs
- **Celery:** For Python-based background tasks (e.g., automated backups, environment secrets generation).
- **Bull:** For Node.js-based background tasks (e.g., connection testing, CSRF testing).

---

## 8. File Storage
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage will be used for storing and managing files (e.g., images, documents).
- **Recommendation:** AWS S3 is preferred for its scalability and integration with other AWS services.

---

## 9. Security
