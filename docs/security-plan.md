# Security Plan Documentation

## 1. Authentication
- **OAuth 2.0:** For Admin and Manager roles, allowing login via Google accounts.
- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** An additional security layer for all roles.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure session management.

## 2. Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - **Admin:** Full access to all features and data.
  - **Manager:** Access to campaigns, ads, and analytics.
  - **User:** Access to content creation and product optimization.

## 3. Data Encryption
- **At Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) using AES-256.
- **In Transit:** Use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher for secure communication.

## 4. Input Validation
- **Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **Validation:** Validate inputs using libraries like `validator.js`.

## 5. Rate Limiting
- **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs.
- **IP Blocking:** Block IPs that exceed rate limits or show suspicious activity.

## 6. Security Headers
- **Helmet:** Use Helmet to set HTTP security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options).

## 7. Audit Logging
- **Logging:** Log all user actions and API requests for auditing purposes.
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor logs in real-time.

## 8. Spam and Bot Protection
- **reCAPTCHA:** Use reCAPTCHA to prevent spam and bot activity.
- **Bot Detection:** Use tools like Cloudflare Bot Management to detect and block bots.

## 9. DDoS Prevention
- **Cloudflare:** Use Cloudflare to mitigate DDoS attacks.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application level.

## 10. Fraud Detection
- **Machine Learning:** Use machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities (e.g., fake accounts, payment fraud).
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

## 11. Compliance
- **GDPR:** Ensure compliance with GDPR for user data protection.
- **PCI DSS:** Ensure compliance with PCI DSS for payment processing.

## 12. Incident Response
- **Incident Response Plan:** Document steps to handle security incidents (e.g., data breaches, DDoS attacks).
- **Communication Plan:** Notify stakeholders and users in case of a security incident.

## 13. Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools like Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
