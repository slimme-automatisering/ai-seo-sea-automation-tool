# Performance Optimization Documentation

## 1. Frontend Performance
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `React.lazy` to load components only when needed.
- **Code Splitting:** Split the app into smaller bundles to reduce initial load time.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Image Optimization:** Use compressed images and lazy loading for images.

## 2. Backend Performance
- **Database Indexing:** Index frequently queried fields (e.g., `Users.email`, `Keywords.keyword`).
- **Caching:** Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., analytics, competitor data).
- **Query Optimization:** Optimize database queries to reduce response times.

## 3. Network Performance
- **Minimize Payloads:** Reduce the size of API responses by only including necessary data.
- **Compression:** Use gzip or Brotli to compress API responses.
- **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets.

## 4. Monitoring
- **Prometheus:** Monitor backend performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates).
- **Grafana:** Visualize performance metrics using Grafana dashboards.
- **New Relic:** Monitor frontend and backend performance in real-time.

## 5. Testing
- **Load Testing:** Use Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate high traffic and identify bottlenecks.
- **Stress Testing:** Test the app under extreme conditions to identify breaking points.
